        "\n",
        "## **Objective:**\n",
        "The purpose of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of various structured prompts in generating accurate and insightful responses regarding an employee management database. The goal was to analyze the database's structure, relationships, potential use cases, and supported SQL queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Findings:**\n",
        "Several variations of prompts were tested, each designed to extract meaningful insights about the database. The responses were evaluated for correctness, coherence, and practical value.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Analysis of Table Relationships and Data Linkages**\n",
        "- The output correctly identified the relationships between tables (one-to-many relationships between `employees` and both `salary` and `studies`).\n",
        "- It successfully described how these relationships facilitate career growth tracking.\n",
        "- No hallucinations or errors were detected in the response structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. Potential Use Cases and Functional Capabilities of the Database**\n",
        "- The response highlighted valuable HR tasks, such as tracking salary trends, identifying top performers, and analyzing education's impact on compensation.\n",
        "- The generated use cases were relevant and well-articulated.\n",
        "- Some minor redundancy was noted in the task descriptions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Types of SQL Queries Supported and Their Applications**\n",
        "- The AI provided well-structured explanations for query types (aggregations, joins, filtering, and ranking).\n",
        "- Example use cases were contextually appropriate, aligning well with the database schema.\n",
        "- No significant errors were observed, though additional real-world SQL examples could improve response quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Challenges & Limitations:**\n",
        "- In some instances, the AI output included generic insights that did not fully leverage the provided schema.\n",
        "- While the AI did not hallucinate relationships, there were occasional oversimplifications in descriptions of data usage.\n",
        "- The lack of real SQL code examples in certain responses limited practical applicability.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Lessons Learned:**\n",
        "- Detailed prompts that specify relationships explicitly help mitigate AI-generated assumptions.\n",
        "- Providing a structured response format enhances clarity and usability of the output.\n",
        "- Encouraging the AI to include SQL snippets could further improve response quality.\n",
        "- Fine-tuning the balance between brevity and detail ensures responses remain insightful without being overly verbose.\n",
        "\n",
        "## **Conclusion:**\n",
        "The structured prompt approach proved highly effective in extracting meaningful database insights. While the responses were mostly accurate and useful, minor refinements, such as including more SQL-specific examples, could further enhance their value. Future work could focus on refining prompt design to encourage more precise, context-aware responses.\n",
